# 👋 Hi, I'm Sai Medhini Reddy Maryada

I'm a Software Development Engineer at **Amazon**, contributing to **OpenSearch** — a distributed search and analytics engine. I’m passionate about building scalable, developer-friendly systems and growing open-source communities.

## 🔧 What I Work On

- **Maintainer**: `opensearch-py`, `opensearch-php`, `dashboards-flow-framework` — led key feature development, triaged issues, reviewed 100+ PRs, and engaged with community contributors.
- **Automated** full API generation pipelines across multiple languages using OpenSearch specs — reduced manual effort and ensured consistency across client SDKs.
- Introduced **YAML-based test runners** to boost coverage and catch backward compatibility issues before release.
- Designed and integrated **client-side performance metrics** into benchmarking workflows, enabling early detection of latency bottlenecks in OpenSearch client libraries.
- Built and maintained full-stack features using **React.js**, **TypeScript**, **Redux**, and **Jest/Cypress** for Dashboards Flow Framework — shipped major components and authored 90%+ of test coverage.
- Merged `opensearch-dsl-py` into `opensearch-py`, simplifying the Python client experience and reducing maintenance overhead.
- Led and contributed to release engineering for `opensearch-py` and `dashboards-flow-framework` — managed pipelines, created changelogs, and ensured timely, stable rollouts.
- Mentored open-source contributors through the OpenSearch College Initiative — created a hands-on [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/igzzlPponiw?si=jbOYFKDrFCzYTcVO) with 2K+ views to guide new contributors.
